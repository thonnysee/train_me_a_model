Family images for testing purposes using testing files from the internet to create the dataset.

There are 20 images for testing.

## Labelling Software

As intended I used the Labellmg project to label all the images 1 by 1

## Labels

In this training I used 7 classes for the training which are:

* dog
* son
* father
* mother
* daughter
* grandmother
* grandfather

## Trained graph

There is already a result for the first 10k epochs training used with these settings: 

```cmd
/inference_graph/frozen_inference_graph.pb
```

Or you can train yourself using these images.
